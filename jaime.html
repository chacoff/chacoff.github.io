<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
  I am versatile and data-driven engineer skilled in mathematical modeling and process analytics, with in-depth expertise in computer
vision and data science. My background is in applied physics, optics and electronics. My research interests include Artificial
Intelligence, Machine Learning, Space Robotics, Image processing, GANs & Big Data Analytics.

<br>
  I finished my Bachelor in Physics in 2007 where i attended courses of Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Spectroscopy, Mechanical Statistic, Solid-state physics among several mathematical courses.
<br>
  I graduated in Physics Engineering in 2010, where I had a strong formation in Electronics & Digital Electronics, Sensors and Image Processing.  My thesis was in Machine Learning for Image Processing developing automatic algorithm with the use of SVMs in order to classify images.
